# space_game_5867
A 2D space game that allows different play styles like trading, piracy, joining a faction. I imagine it as some sort of space ship simulation with rather big crews with needs. Ships start from small, one man ships, to ships with crews of about 50 NPC's and complex design. Ships have then different departments like a bridge, crew quarters, engine and cargo. All of which need to be managed by crew members who themselves have needs like food, mood, money etc. money might not be an issue if you join a faction. 




## the Player
The Player is the commander of his/her ship. He is free to trade, attack or do whatever is possible in the limits of the game (hopefully not much)

## the Ships
Ships should be completely explorable for the player and also manageble with specific UIs. A little bit like a city sim. 

## Battle System
A rather unconventional idea would be to just give orders and have your crew execute them depending on their well beeing and skill(a nice rpg system for skills could work well gere). This would be close to actually commanding a space ship. I fear this might get boring to quickly or be unsatisfying as you can't put in your skill as a player. 

## Universe 
The universe consists of systems with different opportunities (different levels of danger, different goods etc.)
